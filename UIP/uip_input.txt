Title: XAMPP, MySQL and PDO on my local machine
Description:
I was able to install XAMPP, troubleshoot a few bugs in it (because I already had a MySQL server running on the same port from an older project), and study more of the git repository for the offboarding form. I am able to run the the form through the Apache server and am reviewing how to run the PDO and understand the code better.
Seems we have a meeting tomorrow on 3:00pm, I will definitely make it there and try my best to understand the task and contribute.
