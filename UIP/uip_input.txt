Title: Debugging AJAX, JS, and PHP
Description:
Lots of debugging of the repository. I was able to get some errors out of the way but still far from done. Currently investigating the connection between AJAX and offboarding.php. Will try putting debugging logs so I can see what is actually happening in the PHP file rather than just assuming what worked and what failed.
