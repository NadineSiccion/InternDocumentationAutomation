Title: Final Touches on Project 
Description:
Worked on final touches to make my project ready for submitting. There are still many features I believe I could implement however I cannot given the limited time and my limited experience. Though, I am happy with the fully function CRUD RESTful API backend made with PHP and the hands on experience I've gained with the MVC framework. This has been a wonderful learning experience for me. I am working on writing the email to request for my remaining weekly reports and am now eligible for requesting Offboarding, which I will work on tomorrow. Thank you very much for this journey!
